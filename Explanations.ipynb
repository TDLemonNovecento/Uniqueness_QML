    "The datastructure is intended to be as follows: For any folder containing xyz files, all files can be processed with the methods implemented. This allows screening of existing and randomly generated databases such as QM7. If for any representation the mapping function from xyz file to the representation is known, then the first and second derivative with respect to properties of chemical space can be calculated."

# Uniqueness_QML
This is the branched archive for first files and pieces of codes written within this project. It contains all sympy files e.g. which will no longer be used as jax seems to be the better options for calculating derivatives.

Investigates breakdown of uniqueness for corse grained representations. Uses: QM9 dataset, jax package for the derivatives
